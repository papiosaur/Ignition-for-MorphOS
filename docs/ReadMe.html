	<dl><dt><h3>Notes about this release</h3></dt>
		<dd>
		<p>
		This is a beta release of ignition for MorphOS. For now, its user interface
		is completely in German, but the localisation is currently underway. Sorry
		for any inconvenience.
		</p>
		<p>
		Some further remarks:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the TurboCalc import module is not yet finished - it doesn't support multiple pages, for example</li>
			<li>Excel import/export filters are not included in this release</li>
			<li>Printing and saving of documents have been disabled for this release</li>
			<li>The provided documentation is only basic at this point. The next release will include HTML docs
				in both, English and German.</li>
		</ul>
        </dd>

	<dl><dt><h3>Notes about the compatibility to MorphOS</h3></dt>
		<dd><p>
			ignition was specifically adapted to run better on MorphOS, but there are
			still some issues left. Notably:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>There is a bug in the picture.datatype that prevents ignition to correctly
					show its icons - they are all rendered using wrong colors. If this won't be
					fixed for the final MorphOS release, this will be worked around, though.</li>
				<li>Printing has not been tested</li>
				<li>You may need very recent version of locale.library, iffparse.library, and
					ft2.library for ignition to work correctly - if they aren't publicly available yet,
					it's safe to use the AmigaOS counterparts (bullet.library instead of ft2.library)</li>
				<li>You should have some vector fonts installed - this beta doesn't include any
					fonts.</li>
				<li>AmigaGuide support is still missing in MorphOS, and thus, the context sensitive help
					won't work at all if you don't have installed the AmigaOS version of it.</li>
				<li>With very large font sizes and a deep zoom level, it can happen that texts
					aren't visible anymore. This seems to be an internal limit of the ft2.library -
					the next release might impose stricter limits on the maximum font size to
					hide this "feature" from you.</li>
			</ul>
