Description
-----------
An easy to use suite of routines that provides an interface to the system 
rendering functions, but with the added bonus that all drawing operations are 
clipped against a specified rectangular region. MUCH better at clipping 
filled polygons than the system routines (the size of the polygon can be up to 
2^31 pixels). 

Includes full source and object files for both SAS/C and GCC.

Requires
--------
o WB 2.0 (or better).
o 68020 (or better).
